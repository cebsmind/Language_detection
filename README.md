# Project : Language Detection 
This is my first project in Data Science. The goal was to create a Machine Learning model to detect the language input. I also created a small web site and deployed it via pythonanywhere.com so everyone can acces it for free as it's a small app.

# App preview 
You can acces to the site here :  [MySite](https://cebsmind.pythonanywhere.com/)
